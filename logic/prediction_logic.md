# Prediction Logic

1. Collect last 7 days of mess attendance
2. Compute trend using AI-based estimation
3. Apply safety buffer to avoid shortages
4. Categorize queue level:

- Low: ≤ 80 students
- Medium: 81–150 students
- High: > 150 students

This logic ensures predictable and actionable queue insights.
